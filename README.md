# Server Dotfiles

## Install

The bootstrap script will back up all your existing files before it installs anything
new, it'll also warn you if a dependency isn't met.

```bash
$ bash < <( curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/augustash/serverdots/master/bootstrap.sh )
```

Don't worry, all your old files will be backed up!

## Stay Updated

Run the bootstrap script again!

```bash
$ ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```
